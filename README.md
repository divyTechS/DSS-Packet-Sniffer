# 🛰️ DSS Packet Sniffer

A modern, GUI-based **network packet sniffer** built with **Python and PyQt5**, designed to analyze live network traffic in real-time — with **aesthetic dark theme, sapphire accents, ML-ready architecture**, and a smooth user experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Real-Time Packet Capture** – View live packets flowing through your system.  
- 🧠 **Smart Classification (ML-Ready)** – Architecture designed to integrate machine learning for detecting suspicious packets.  
- 🌈 **Modern Dark Sapphire UI** – Beautiful, minimal, and futuristic interface built with PyQt5.  
- 📊 **Traffic Statistics Dashboard** – Shows live packet counts, traffic graph, and color-coded alerts.  
- 💾 **Logging & Export** – Save captured packets and export logs for later analysis.  
- ⚙️ **Root-Aware Execution** – Captures packets using `scapy` with root permissions on Linux.  
- 🧰 **Cross-Platform Ready** – Tested on Linux and Windows; runs standalone via executable file.

## 🛠️ Installation

### **Option 1: Run from Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/divyTechS/DSS-Packet-Sniffer.git
cd DSS-Packet-Sniffer/src
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
sudo python3 main.py
````

> ⚠️ Root access (`sudo`) is required for live packet capture.

---

### **Option 2: Run the Executable (Recommended)**

```bash
cd dist/Safffire
sudo ./Safffire
```

✅ No need to install dependencies.
✅ GUI launches instantly.

---

## 🔐 Root Permission Note

Network sniffing requires access to raw sockets, which are privileged operations.
Run the app with **root/admin rights** to enable full packet capture.

On Linux:

```bash
sudo ./Safffire
```

On Windows (future builds):

> Right-click → Run as Administrator
